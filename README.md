# FootballProject
Data was gathered from statsbomb.
We cleaned the data and used specific features to plot our visualisations.
We have plotted Passing Networks and Shot Maps of teams.
We have also plotted Heatmap of specific players from a given match.
Passing network only plotted if the passes were atleast 2 or more than that. The bigger the circle the more tha passes have been given to or passed from that person
In Shotmaps the bigger the circles the more chance of the goal being scored.
Heatmaps of players include the player's position when he was dribbling , carrying, shooting and passing.Using all these positions we have plotted the player's position on the field.
We have also created a webpage for all these visualisations to be displayed on. 
The webpage is hosted on the internet for anyone who wants to access it.
the link to the webpage is atrix.pythonanywhere.com
